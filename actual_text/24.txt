Disadvantages Symbolic • Analytical solutions Sometimes can't be
solved • Lets you intuit things | • Can be overly compliabout solution form
cated Numeric • Always get a solution • Hard to extract a deep
understanding • Can make solutions | • Num. methods someaccurate
times fail • Easy to code
• Can take a while to compute
