Nature of Strategic Evaluation
Nature of the strategic evaluation and control process is to test the effectiveness of strategy. During the two proceedings phases of the strategic management process, the strategists formulate the strategy to achieve a set of objectives and then implement the strategy. There has to be a way of finding out whether the strategy being implemented will guide the organisation towards its intended objectives Strategic evaluation and control, therefore, performs the crucial task of keeping the organisation on the right track. In the absence of such a mechanism, there would be no means for strategists to find out whether or not the strategy is producing the desired effect.
